# Glass Curtain Wall Installation Dataset
A unitised curtain wall is a type of exterior wall for high-rise buildings, which is comprised of prefabricated modules that hang from the building floor slabs. This dataset depicts a partially installed unitised curtain wall.

The dataset consists of
- 140 images depicting a partially installed unitised curtain wall
- The camera calibration parameters
- Measurement of the pose (position and orientation) of the camera with respect to the wall
- Ground truth images for 60 images from the dataset, segmented as [glass, frame, other]

The dataset is primarily intended to be used in the development of systems to automatically measure the relative pose between the camera and the wall; systems to identify the location where the next curtain wall module should be installed; and related user interfaces.
